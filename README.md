# Enhancing E-commerce Chatbots with Falcon-7B and 16-bit Full Quantization

## Abstract
E-commerce chatbots play a crucial role in customer service but often struggle with understanding complex
queries. This study introduces a breakthrough approach leveraging the Falcon-7B model, a state-of-the-art Large
Language Model (LLM) with 7 billion parameters. Trained on a vast dataset of 1,500 billion tokens from RefinedWeb and
curated corpora, the Falcon-7B model excels in natural language understanding and generation. Notably, its 16-bit full
quantization transformer ensures efficient computation without compromising scalability or performance. By harnessing
cutting-edge machine learning techniques, our method aims to redefine e-commerce chatbot systems, providing businesses
with a robust solution for delivering personalized customer experiences.
